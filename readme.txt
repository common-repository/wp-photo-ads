Automagically changes the link of any image added through the Wordpress image tool into a link that can be used to serve your users within any page.

== Description ==

WP Photo Ads is a Wordpress plugin that will allow Wordpress users to easily change every image link on their blog, point these links to a page that's fully customizable and thus give them the ability to ad advertising on these image pages. This can drastically up the amount of ad impressions on specific types of sites, but will pretty much have a positive impact on the revenue stream of every Wordpress site this plugin is installed on...

**Features of this first public release**

WP Photo Ads works retro-active. Older posts with "normal" image links will be changed once the plugin is installed, upping the earning potential of your old blog entries.

WP Photo Ads will not touch images NOT linking to their own full version. If you're linking images to their full version on another site, or to its source on another blog - these links will remain untouched. Also, photos linking to the Wordpress attachment page will remain untouched.

WP Photo Ads is full customizable. The image file that will be used to show your large image version is very easy to edit, and you can even build a new one from scratch to fully match your design. For the unexperienced users, we do have a standard template available with the plugin.
	
== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.Upload your personal image.php file and point the plugin to its direction using the WP Photo Ads control page  in the Wordpress admin panel.
